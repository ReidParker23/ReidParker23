- Hi, I’m Reid Parker (@ReidParker23). I am a game designer and programmer.
- I’m interested in working as a designer/programmer in video game development.
- I’m currently learning C++. I know how to program in Unreal Engine using Blueprint visual scripting, and so I'm working on filling in my C++ knowledge.
- I’m looking to collaborate on game development projects in need of a designer and/or programmer!
