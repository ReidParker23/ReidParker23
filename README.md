# Hello, I'm Reid

I am enthusiastic about information and data security and enjoy solving the challenges that face organizations with regards to their data and the data of the people they serve.

## Objective

Most of my life has been spent around computers in varying capacities. Through these interactions I developed an interest in cybersecurity. When presented with an opportunity to transition my career to the field, I took it. Now, I am aiming for a role as a security analyst, and continuing to develop my skills and knowledge.
